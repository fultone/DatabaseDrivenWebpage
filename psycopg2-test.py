    This is a short example of how to access a PostgreSQL database in Python.
'''

import psycopg2
import getpass

# Get the database login info
database = 'fultone'
user = 'fultone'
password = getpass.getpass()

# Login to the database
try:
    connection = psycopg2.connect(database=database, user=user, password=password)
except Exception as e:
    print 'Connection error: ', e
    exit()

# Query the database
try:
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    query = "SELECT summary, city, statesighted, datesighted, shape, duration, latitude, longitude FROM ufo WHERE statesighted='MN' "
      #place  FROM earthquakes WHERE mag>7 ORDER BY mag DESC
    cursor.execute(query)
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        print row

    # An alternative to "for row in cursor.fetchall()" is "for row in cursor". The former
    # brings all the data into memory in your program, while the latter brings data in
    # small pieces (one row at a time, I think, but I haven't verified it yet).

except Exception as e:
    print 'Cursor error', e
    connection.close()
    exit()

connection.close()
