Web Project Pair E, October 2017

For our website project we used data from the National UFO Reporting Center to construct a database in which users can search for specific UFO sightings based on city, state, UFO shape, date sighted, or keyword. The data set also includes a summary which gives a detailed account of what was observed. 

Website Features: 
- Displays the main sections of the website clearly in the page navigation 
- Clearly identifies where to search for UFO sightings
- When the user searches for a UFO the information is presented in a clear and organized way, which includes the summary, city, state, date sighted, shape, and duration
- The search tool includes a filter for keyword, shape, city, and state
- The homepage features the UFO sighting of the week
- The website includes a Shop where various alien-related items can be purchased
- The website includes a Contact page where the user can contact the creators of the website

Citation:
The UFO Sightings dataset was taken from the National UFO Reporting Center. There is no direct link to the dataset, but we copied a select amount of the data as sorted by date sighted (http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxevent.html) from the National UFO Reporting Center Website. Permission to use this data was found on the Information and Policies Page: "One of the Center's policies, which distinguishes its operations from most other UFO organizations, is that it makes available to the public all of its data in summary form." (http://www.nuforc.org/General.html)

Features We Wish We Had Time To Implement:
- Allow the user to submit their own UFO Sightings; this information would then be added to the database
- Display the locations of the UFO sightings on a map
